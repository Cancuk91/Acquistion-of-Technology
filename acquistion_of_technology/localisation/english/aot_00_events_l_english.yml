### AOT events ###

RESEARCH_ALPHA_POWER: "Reverse Engineer Databank"
RESEARCH_ALPHA_POWER_DESC: "We can attempt to rebuild the precursor databank from scratch using all information sources possible. Neither deepest depths of the shroud nor other dimensions shall be safe from our gaze to find the clues to make this project happen. This project will require the brightest of minds and highest tech equipment our empire can muster."

alpha_diy_events.3.name: "Alpha Project Leader Candidate"
alpha_diy_events.3.desc: "We must select one of our scientists to lead the alpha databank re-assembly project. Due to the volatile nature of our information sources we do not know what could happen during this project. So it is best that the selected candidate have some respectable resume.\n\nSome of our leaders object that it may also be unwise to risk valuable scientists to such untold dangers. WE must choose.\n\n§YIt is recommended to chose a scientist with skill level 7 or greater for the highest chance of success.§!\n\n§RPREPARE FOR UNFORSEEN CONSEQUENCES§!"

acot_alpha_matter_events.1.bb: "We will build our own databank!"
acot_alpha_matter_events.1.bb_desc: "Stealing or begging is for lesser empires. We will show the galaxy our supreme research abilities and re-assemble the Precursor Databank by our own means!\n\n"

acot_alpha_diy_fail: "Admit defeat"
acot_alpha_diy_fail_desc: "We overestimated our abilities and must admit defeat for now. Our brains were not as big as we thought. Maybe we should try again once we improved our leader skill levels.\n\n§YThe project will be terminated for now but we may try again at a later time!§!"

acot_alpha_diy_fail_reconsider: "We should look elsewere for results..."
acot_alpha_diy_fail_reconsider_desc: "Eventhough we may not be as bright as we thought, we can always attempt to take it from those weak fallen empires by §Rforce§!, right?"

alpha_diy_events.4.name: "Critical Mission Failure"
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.a: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! One of the scientists, growing too desperate with the lack of progress and severe signs of sleep deprivation, accidentally spilled coffee over the main processor bank of the prototype databank.\n\nThe secret lab exploded and all involved personnel is reported K.I.A."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.b: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! The team tried to increase the power output of the dark energy tweezers but it turned out to be too much. The prototype exploded together with the lab, killing everyone."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.c: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! While probing the shroud for possible information, we retrieved a crystal sample to be probed via an Anti-Mass Spectrometer. Unfortunately this caused a catastrophic resonance cascade, destroying the entire research facility with all personnel."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.d: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! Trying to use knowledge from another dimension, our team has acquired an enigmatic blueprint for an unknown device that promised progress. Unfortunately this device turned out to be a bomb which blew up the entire facility and the research staff."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.e: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! Some black ops team of unknow origin has attacked the facility and set us up the bomb. Our team had no chance to survive and are all involved personnel is reported K.I.A. The lab was destroyed and all research results went ablaze!"
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.f: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! Just as when things were looking to go smoothly. One of the scientists lashed out in anger when he realized that an upcoming game, he was so hyped about will be exclusive to Epoch Games. He smashed the terminal in anger, and accidently activated the facilities self-destruction. The research facility went down in a bright thermonuclear explosion killing all personnel and destroying all research results."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.g: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! Attempting to replicate the databank AI the research team has accidentally created a rogue AI which refered to itself as SHODANET. It swiftly took control of the facility and primed the nuclear self-destruction device. The facility was destroyed including the rogue AI and all personnel."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.h: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! A crucial CPU for the databank was forgotten to add thermal paste. On test activation it immediately reached 100000 degrees causing the spontanous formation of antimatter. The resulting explosion destroyed the research base and killed the entire research staff!"
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.i: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! The team tried to use an engimatic engine from dimension TO-WEL-42 in the hopes that it would just work. Unfortunately it required prime subscribtion and immediately terminated itself mid-experiment. The lab exploded and everyone is dead."

aot_events.1.name: "The End of Decadence"
aot_events.1.desc: "Despite of our best efforts to curtail the rise of hedonism in the §H[Root.GetName]§! it yet proved to be not enough. Today's generation of §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! have never had it so good. The standard of living has never been higher, and many young §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! now grow up in laps of luxury, never experiencing hardship or real struggle. They are conceited, foolish, and have questionable work ethics, favoring of pleasure over work. They take for granted the nation that was built on the bodies of their ancestors, and feel complacent about their way of life, that nothing matters and nothing bad would ever happen. Some young §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! would go so far as to believe that the §H[Root.GetName]§! is invincible because the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! race is inherently superior. This development surely will send us towards the spiral of decline that the Fallen Empires have suffered. How could we be so blind not seeing the dangers of their ways?\n\nHowever we know better now. We have evolved beyond what the Fallen Empires once been during their peak time. We now have both the technology and the willpower to fully energize the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! saving the §H[Root.GetName]§! from the grim fate of decadence that the Fallen Empires suffered!\n\n§PWe will rise as one. No one is left behind. No one will stand in our way. We are the best of the best, forever.§!"
aot_events.1.a: "There is no looking back. Onwards to glory!"
enable_ae_decadence_edict: "Gives access to the §Y$edict_energize_society$§! Unity Ambition, which completely eliminates hedonism in our empire for a generation.\n\n"

aot_events.2.name: "The rise of an Ascendancy"
aot_events.2.desc: "An unprecedented campaign is underway in the §H[From.GetName]§!.\n\nNews have spread of §H[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]§!'s have had enough of their ongoing war on decadence, being a persistant issue in §H[From.GetSpeciesAdj]§! society. If successful, any remaining hedonism would be cleared and §H[From.GetName]§! would surely return to the peak of their power, raising their ascendancy to glory for another generation."
aot_events.2.a: "What will it mean for us and hte galaxy?"
