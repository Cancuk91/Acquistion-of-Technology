pc_ascended_habitat: "Dark Matter Habitat"
pc_ascended_habitat_desc: "A very advanced form of space habitation used only be the most sophisticated of civilisations that mastered £sr_dark_matter£ Dark Matter and £acot_sr_dark_energy£ Dark Energy."

decision_convert_habitat: "Dark Matter Habitat Conversion"
decision_convert_habitat_desc: "This decision converts this habitat into a sophisticated §Y$pc_ascended_habitat$§!, the pinnacle of vertical space habitation with perfect habitability for every known species in the galaxy."

decision_upgrade_ascended_habitat: "Expand habitat I"
decision_upgrade_ascended_habitat_desc: "By adding additional 6 auxilary habitation units we can increase the amount of £district£ districts by additional §Y4§!."

decision_upgrade_ascended_habitat_2: "Expand habitat II"
decision_upgrade_ascended_habitat_2_desc: "By adding additional 6 auxilary habitation units we can furtherly increase the total amount of £district£ districts by §Y4§!, to a total size of §Y16§!!"

decision_ascended_habitat_project_effects: "This project rebuilds this habitat from the ground up to better fit the awesomeness and aesthetics of our empire. The first stage provides a total amount of §Y8§! £district£ districts, with the option to expand up to §Y16§! £district£ districts!\n\nThis highly advanced type of habitat specializes into the generation of £sr_dark_matter£ Dark Matter, £acot_sr_dark_energy£ Dark Energy and eventually even £acot_sr_stellarite£ Stellarite!"

decision_dm_habitat_expand_requirements: "§HBefore we can expand this habitat any further §Rwe must fully develop all £district£ districts§! first.§!"

tech_dm_habitat: "Dark Matter Habitats"
tech_dm_habitat_desc: "By employing our combined knowledge about £sr_dark_matter£ Dark Matter and £acot_sr_dark_energy£ Dark Energy, we can craft a new generation of space habitats using our old habitat infrastructure. This will allow us to upgrade our old and outdated habitats to match both the needs and aesthetics of our empire."

tech_dm_habitat_upgrade_I: "Advanced Dark Matter Habitats"
tech_dm_habitat_upgrade_I_desc: "The modular architecture of the §Y$pc_ascended_habitat$§! allows us to improve it even further with additional auxilary habitation units."

tech_dm_habitat_upgrade_II: "Perfected Dark Matter Habitats"
tech_dm_habitat_upgrade_II_desc: "With our obtained knowledge we can now perfect the §Y$pc_ascended_habitat$§! architecture, unlocking its full potential. It is nothing short but a miracle of both integrated design and engineering."
