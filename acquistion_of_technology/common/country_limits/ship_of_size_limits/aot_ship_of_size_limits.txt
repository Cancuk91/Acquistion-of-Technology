# Please don't use these limits for ship sizes which can be used by federation, community or global designs. 
# It can result the wrong naval cap calculations (there are special adjustments for naval cap of ships of such designs).
# Example:
#name_of_limit = {
#	ship_types = { 
#		# list of keys to ship_sizes database, these ship_sizes will share the calculated capacity
#	}
#	
#	# Defines the shared capacity of the specified ships that country is allowed to own
#	# capacity = min( max, base + naval_cap_fraction * current_naval_cap )
#	# where current_naval_cap is current naval capacity of the country
#	base = 1					# Base (minimal) shared capacity of ships
#	max = 200					# Maximal shared capacity of ships
#	naval_cap_fraction = 0.1	# Fraction of current naval capacity of the country
#
#	# Trigger that defines if tooltip for naval capacity icon on the top bar should be shown
